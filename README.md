# CodeIgniter 4 Application Starter

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the 
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/). 

##
With that out of the way it’s time to view your application in a browser. You can serve it through any server of your choice, Apache, Nginx, etc, but CodeIgniter comes with a simple command that takes advantage of PHP’s built-in server to get you up and running fast on your development machines. Type the following on the command line from the root of your project:

php spark serve
